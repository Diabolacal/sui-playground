## 1. Build & Lint Gates

### 1.1 Move Package

| Gate | Command | Expected | Frequency |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Build | `sui move build --path contracts/civcontrol` | 0 errors, 0 warnings | After every Move source change |
| Test | `sui move test --path contracts/civcontrol` | All tests pass | After every Move source change |
| Publish (dry run) | `sui client publish --path contracts/civcontrol --dry-run` | Gas estimate returned, no errors | Before actual publish |

**Abort codes to test for:**
| Module | Code | Meaning | Test Method |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `gate_permit` | 0 | ETribeMismatch | Wrong-tribe character calls `request_jump_permit` |
| `gate_permit` | 1 | EInsufficientPayment | Payment less than toll price |
| `trade_post` | 0 | EListingInactive | Buy on cancelled listing |
| `trade_post` | 1 | EInsufficientFunds | Coin value < listing price |
| `trade_post` | 2 | ESSUMismatch | Listing SSU ID ≠ passed SSU |

### 1.1b Pre-Mainnet: Formal Verification (Sui Prover)

> **Not in hackathon scope.** Included here to document our intent before any real-value deployment.

Before deploying contracts to mainnet (real assets at risk), all economic-critical Move modules must be formally verified using the [Sui Prover](https://github.com/asymptotic-code/sui-prover) (Boogie/Z3-based, supports Move 2024).

| Module | Properties to Prove | Priority |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| `gate_permit` | Toll payment atomicity, no-double-toll, rule evaluation completeness | P0 |
| `courier_escrow` | Balance conservation, state machine correctness | P0 |
| `trade_post` | Payment atomicity, no partial fills | P1 |
| `gate_toll` | Arithmetic overflow safety, fee math correctness | P1 |

Specs will live in a separate `specs/` package using Sui Prover's `#[spec(prove)]` attribute and `target` mechanism (required until upstream integration lands). See [Sui Prover Guide](https://info.asymptotic.tech/sui-prover-guide) for specification patterns.

### 1.2 Frontend (React + TypeScript)

| Gate | Command | Expected | Frequency |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| TypeScript check | `npm run typecheck` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`) | 0 errors | After every TS change |
| Build | `npm run build` | Production build succeeds, 0 warnings treated as errors | After every TS change |
| Dev server | `npm run dev` | Starts on localhost, no console errors | Spot check after major changes |
| Lint | `npm run lint` (if configured) | 0 errors | Before commit |

### 1.3 Combined Gate (run before every commit)

```bash
# Move
sui move build --path contracts/civcontrol
sui move test --path contracts/civcontrol

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

All four must pass. Any failure blocks commit.

## 2. Step-Level Verification

### Phase 0: Day-1 Validation

| Step | Verification Method | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------------------|---------------|

| S03 | `grep -n "authorize_extension\|issue_jump_permit\|withdraw_item\|struct Item" vendor/world-contracts/...` | Signatures match documented (A1-A4) |

> **UPDATED (v0.0.15):** `withdraw_item<Auth>` signature has changed — now takes `quantity: u32` + `ctx: &mut TxContext`. `deposit_item<Auth>` validates `parent_id`. S03 grep must verify against v0.0.15 signatures, not v0.0.13.
| S04 | `sui client active-env` | Returns target environment name |
| S05 | Sponsored tx dry run passes | No `ENotAuthorizedSponsor` abort |

| S30 | No banned terms in UI | Grep for "Dashboard\|Admin\|Settings\|Notifications" returns 0 hits in components |

### Phase 5: ZK Stretch

| Step | Verification Method | Pass Criteria | Kill Criteria |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| S31 | Circuit compiles, test proof generates | Proof in < 5s | R1: fails → kill |
| S32 | Browser WASM generates proof | Proof valid, < 2s | R2: > 5s → kill |

## 3. Deterministic Proof Moment Validation

The 5 non-negotiable proof moments must each produce verifiable on-chain evidence:

### Proof Moment 1: Policy Deploy

| Aspect | Validation |
|--------|-----------|
| **What to capture** | Transaction digest from `set_tribe_rule` + `set_coin_toll` deployment |
| **Verification command** | `sui client tx-block <DIGEST> --json` |
| **Expected fields** | `status: "success"`, effects show DF creation on CivControlConfig |
| **UI evidence** | Rule Composer shows "Policy deployed" + tx link |

### Proof Moment 2: Hostile Denied

| Aspect | Validation |
|--------|-----------|
| **What to capture** | Transaction digest from wrong-tribe `request_jump_permit` attempt |
| **Verification command** | `sui client tx-block <DIGEST> --json` |
| **Expected fields** | `status: "failure"`, `error` contains abort code 0 (ETribeMismatch) from `civcontrol::gate_permit` |
| **UI evidence** | Transaction feedback shows "Jump denied. Tribe mismatch." Signal Feed entry with red indicator. |

### Proof Moment 3: Ally Tolled

| Aspect | Validation |
|--------|-----------|
| **What to capture** | Transaction digest from correct-tribe + toll `request_jump_permit` → `jump_with_permit` |
| **Verification command** | `sui client tx-block <DIGEST> --json` |
| **Expected fields** | `status: "success"`, events include `TollCollectedEvent { amount_mist: 5000000000 }` + `JumpEvent`, balance deltas show toll deduction from jumper + addition to treasury |
| **UI evidence** | Signal Feed shows "Toll collected: 5 SUI" + "Jump permitted" entries. Revenue counter increments. |

### Proof Moment 4: Trade Buy

| Aspect | Validation |
|--------|-----------|
| **What to capture** | Transaction digest from `buy()` call |
| **Verification command** | `sui client tx-block <DIGEST> --json` |
| **Expected fields** | `status: "success"`, events include `TradeSettledEvent`, object changes show Item transferred to buyer, Coin transferred to seller, Listing.is_active = false |
| **UI evidence** | Confirmation: "Trade settled. [Item] acquired for [X] SUI." Balance deltas visible for both buyer and seller. |

### Proof Moment 5: Revenue Visible

| Aspect | Validation |
|--------|-----------|
| **What to capture** | Command Overview screenshot showing aggregated revenue from toll + trade events |
| **Verification method** | Sum of `TollCollectedEvent.amount_mist` + `TradeSettledEvent.price_mist` from `suix_queryEvents` |
| **Expected fields** | Total revenue ≥ (toll amount + trade price). Individual event entries visible in Signal Feed. |
| **UI evidence** | Command Overview revenue card shows total. Signal Feed shows individual events. |

## 4. Runtime Expectations

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Initial page load | < 3s | Browser DevTools, first contentful paint |
| Structure discovery | < 5s | From wallet connect to gate list populated |
| Event polling round-trip | < 2s | `suix_queryEvents` response time |
| PTB construction | < 500ms | Console timing around Transaction build |
| Transaction confirmation | < 10s | From wallet sign to on-chain finality |
| ZK proof generation (if enabled) | < 2s | Browser console timing |

### Error Recovery

| Failure | Expected Behavior | Verification |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Wallet disconnect | All write operations disabled. Read-only mode. Reconnect prompt. | Disconnect wallet → verify UI state |
| RPC timeout | Retry once after 3s. Show "Network unavailable" if retry fails. | Throttle RPC → verify toast |
| Wrong network | "Wrong network" badge. Prompt to switch. | Connect to wrong chain → verify warning |
| Missing Character | "Enter Character ID" prompt. Manual resolution. | New wallet with no Character → verify prompt |
| Transaction failure | Toast with mapped error message. Revert optimistic UI. | Submit invalid PTB → verify error display |

## 6. Continuous Validation Pattern

During implementation, maintain this rhythm:

1. **After every Move change:** `sui move build` + `sui move test`
2. **After every TS change:** `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build`
3. **After every on-chain deployment:** Record tx digest + verify object state
4. **After every PTB integration:** Test with wallet in browser
5. **Before every commit:** Run combined gate (§1.3)
6. **Every 2 hours:** Quick smoke test — wallet connect → gate list → make one change → verify Signal Feed
