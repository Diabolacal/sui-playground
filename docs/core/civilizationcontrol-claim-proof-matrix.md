# CivilizationControl — Claim → Proof Matrix

**Retention:** Carry-forward

> Evidence ledger mapping every demo claim to its proof artifact.
> Sources: shortlist-viability-validation-report.md, gate-lifecycle-runbook.md, gatecontrol-feasibility-report.md, tradepost-cross-address-ptb-validation.md, zk-gatepass-feasibility-report.md, civcontrol-independent-audit.md
> Last updated: 2026-02-24 (environment model to be confirmed March 11)

> **Currency note:** The demo narrative uses **EVE** as the on-chain denomination (e.g., "5 EVE toll"). Sandbox validation artifacts in this matrix were captured using **SUI** (the native devnet coin). Submission-grade evidence will use the EVE denomination on the hackathon test server. **Lux** (10,000 Lux = 1 EVE) is the player-facing display denomination — dual-display (EVE + Lux) is valid in dashboard contexts.

## How to Use This Document

Every claim made in the demo must trace to a row in this matrix. During demo recording, overlay the relevant evidence artifact (tx digest, object ID, balance delta) on-screen at the moment the claim is narrated. Rows marked `[TBD-digest]` require capture during hackathon build on the **hackathon test server** (primary build environment from March 11) — sandbox digests below are proof-of-pattern, not submission artifacts.

### Five Non-Negotiable Proof Moments

If the demo shows nothing else, these five overlays must appear on-screen with their tx digest or state proof. They are marked **★ Tier A** in the matrix below.

1. **Policy deploy** — tx digest proving gate policy (tribe filter + toll) was written on-chain in one action.
2. **Hostile denied** — tx digest showing MoveAbort when a wrong-tribe pilot attempts to jump.
3. **Ally tolled + revenue** — tx digest showing `TollCollectedEvent` (CC custom event) + toll transfer, with operator balance delta.
4. **Trade buy + settlement** — tx digest showing atomic buy (payment to seller, item to buyer, listing deactivated).
5. **Aggregate revenue** — Command Overview screenshot/overlay showing combined toll + trade revenue.

## Utility Metrics

Three quantified targets for the demo. Values marked `[TBD]` are refined during demo recording with real submission-chain data.

### 1. Operations Reduction

**Target:** 20+ CLI commands → 1 click per gate policy change

| Metric | Baseline (CLI) | CivilizationControl | Evidence Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configure tribe + toll rule on one gate | ~8 CLI commands (build, publish, authorize extension, set tribe rule, set toll rule, verify state × 2) | 1 click ("Deploy Policy") | gate-lifecycle-runbook.md Steps 11a-11d |
| Full gate lifecycle setup | 13+ sequential CLI steps | [TBD] steps in UI | gate-lifecycle-runbook.md (13 steps documented) |
| Cross-address buy transaction | ~4 CLI commands (split-coins, assign, move-call buy, verify) | 1 click ("Buy") | shortlist-viability-validation-report.md Test 5 PTB pattern |

**Demo proof:** Side-by-side comparison — raw CLI vs CivilizationControl UI for the same policy change operation.

### 2. Governance Consequence

**Target:** [TBD] policy enforcements captured in demo (minimum 3: one deny, one toll-pass, one permit-jump)

| Metric | Target | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|
| Hostile denied (tribe mismatch) | ≥1 visible in Signal Feed | Failed tx digest + MoveAbort code `(tribe_permit, 0)` from wallet adapter response |
| Ally tolled (payment + passage) | ≥1 visible in Signal Feed | Tx digest showing JumpEvent + custom TollCollectedEvent (extension-emitted) |
| Revenue visible in real-time | Toll revenue counter updates during demo | Before/after balance delta for collector address |
| Policy change reflected in enforcement | ≥1 policy change → subsequent behavior change shown | Two tx digests: before policy (open) and after policy (filtered) |

**Demo proof:** Uninterrupted consequence sequence — set policy → hostile denied → ally tolled → revenue shown.

### 3. Economic Utility

**Target:** [TBD] SUI toll + trade revenue visible in Signal Feed during demo

| Metric | Target | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|
| Toll revenue captured | ≥[TBD] SUI across demo gate jumps | Collector address balance delta |
| Trade revenue captured | ≥[TBD] SUI across demo TradePost buys | Seller address balance delta |
| Combined revenue visible | Total shown in Command Overview or Signal Feed | Aggregate balance summary |
| Atomic settlement proof | ≥1 complete buy showing payment + item transfer in one tx | Tx digest with `TradeSettledEvent` (CC custom) + balance changes |

**Demo proof:** Revenue counter in Signal Feed ticking up as toll + trade events occur.

## Evidence Gaps (To Capture During Hackathon Build)

| Gap | What's Needed | When to Capture | Risk if Missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hackathon test server tx digests | All `[TBD-digest]` rows above | During build on hackathon test server (March 11+) | Cannot overlay tx proof in demo |
| UI-driven policy change tx | Single tx from "Deploy Policy" button | After GateControl UI is functional | Cannot prove operations reduction claim |
| UI-driven buy tx | Single tx from "Buy" button | After TradePost UI is functional | Cannot prove commerce UX claim |
| Real-time Signal Feed screenshot | Screenshot/recording of feed updating in real-time | During demo recording | Cannot prove monitoring claim |
| Revenue totals | Aggregate SUI revenue figures | At end of demo recording session | Cannot state quantified economic utility |
| Sponsored tx evidence (stretch) | Tx showing sponsor ≠ sender | If AdminACL access resolved on test server | Cannot prove gas abstraction claim |
