## Summary

Fortune Gauntlet merges **Fortune Gate** (VRF-probabilistic permit issuance, ID 26) with **The Gauntlet** (sequential multi-gate checkpoint race, Wildcard #6) into a single sprint entry. Players race through 3 checkpoint gates in sequence; at each checkpoint, `sui::random` VRF rolls a 90/10 pass/deny probability. Denial triggers an escalating cooldown before retry. On-chain timestamps serve as verifiable referee. The concept targets **Weirdest Idea ($6K)** with an estimated 35–40% win probability — strictly superior to either standalone variant.

## 8-Criterion Internal Rubric

| # | Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|:-----:|-----------|
| 1 | Concept | **7** | Coherent gate-race-with-danger loop. Feasibility fully validated. Not solving a "felt pain point" but creating a novel competitive mechanic. |
| 2 | Mod Design | **7** | Clean single-package architecture. Per-gate DF config makes checkpoints reusable. Standard ExtensionConfig/AdminCap/XAuth pattern. |
| 3 | Implementation | **7** | All components validated: `entry` function for `sui::random`, DF-based player state, `Clock` time mechanics, custom events. ~200–300 LoC. |
| 4 | Player Utility | **5** | Entertainment/competition experience. Doesn't change how players survive, trade, or coordinate. |
| 5 | Frontier Vibe | **6** | Uses real gate infrastructure, connects to "dangerous space" ethos. Feels more like a minigame than an emergent extension of core loops. |
| 6 | Creativity | **7** | Novel intersection: VRF + gate traversal + on-chain referee. Nobody else will build probabilistic checkpoint racing. |
| 7 | UX | **6** | Race concept is universally understood. Wallet-signing friction at each checkpoint. No in-game browser Sui wallet integration. |
| 8 | Demo | **8** | Strongest dimension. Timer, random rolls, denial tension, escalating cooldowns, final triumph — demo narrative writes itself. |
| — | Player Vote | **7** | Clip-worthy denial moments + triumphant completions. "Random chance × speed run × blockchain proof" is shareable. |

**Judge Average:** 6.63 | **Weighted Total:** 6.72

## FAQ 4-Area Summary

| Area | Score | Key Point |
|------|:-----:|-----------|
| Utility | **5** | Non-trivial on-chain state, but entertainment-only — no operational impact. |
| Technical | **8** | `sui::random` VRF, DF state, `Clock` time, extension pattern, custom events. |
| Creativity | **8** | No existing probabilistic checkpoint race on any chain. "Chain as referee" is clean. |
| Frontier Integration | **6** | Real gates + permits. Game-within-a-game rather than deepening core economic loops. |

**FAQ Composite:** 6.75

## Comparative Scores

| Variant | Weighted | Best Prize | Win Prob |
|---------|:--------:|------------|:--------:|
| Fortune Gate (standalone) | 5.38 | Weirdest Idea | ~65% |
| Gauntlet (standalone) | ~6.44 | Most Creative | ~20% |
| **Fortune Gauntlet** | **6.72** | **Weirdest Idea** | **~35–40%** |

Fortune Gauntlet is +1.34 over Fortune Gate alone (dramatic improvement on Demo +2, Player Vote +2) and ~+0.28 over standalone Gauntlet (VRF differentiation).

> **Note:** Fortune Gate standalone had a higher raw win probability for Weirdest (~65%) because the bar assumed a weaker concept competing. The combined concept is objectively stronger but enters a potentially stronger competitive field. Net: the combined concept is the better entry but win probability adjusts downward from Fortune Gate's original 65% estimate.

---

## Prize-Target Recommendation

**Primary: Weirdest Idea ($6K)** — 35–40% win probability. VRF slot-machine obstacle course through space gates is inherently weird, visual, and meme-worthy. Fortune Gate was already #1 for Weirdest in V3 rankings; the Gauntlet version is strictly superior on every axis.

**Secondary: Most Creative ($6K)** — ~25% fallback via "on-chain VRF referee" angle.

**Not competitive for 1st–3rd place.** Narrow utility (5/10) and moderate Frontier vibe (6/10) prevent it from competing with full-suite entries.

## Kill Criteria

| # | Criterion | Detection | Mitigation |
|---|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | `sui::random` unavailable or unstable on hackathon test server | Test `entry fun` with `&Random` on March 11 devnet | Fall back to deterministic Gauntlet (remove VRF, keep race) |
| 2 | Cannot link 3+ gates owned by same character | Attempt `link_gates` on devnet | Reduce to 2 checkpoints or use unlinked gates with permit-only tracking |
| 3 | `jump_with_permit` sponsor infra not operational | Test dual-sign sponsored tx on March 11 | Kills ALL gate extension entries — shared risk, not Fortune Gauntlet-specific |
| 4 | Combined scope exceeds 2-day sprint budget | Sprint planning velocity at Day 8 | Drop VRF (deterministic Gauntlet) or drop sequence (single Fortune Gate) |
| 5 | Randomness MEV (players observe roll, abort tx) | Verify Sui `Random` security model on March 11 | Sui's `Random` is designed to prevent this; verify before shipping |

## Feasibility Notes

| Capability | Verdict | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Probabilistic permit issuance via `sui::random` | ⚠️ Workaround | `entry` function constraint; compatible with extension pattern since `issue_jump_permit` has no return value |
| Checkpoint progress tracking | ✅ Now | Per-player `PlayerProgress` DF on ExtensionConfig + custom events (`CheckpointPassedEvent`, `CheckpointDeniedEvent`) |
| Consequence — turrets | 🔮 Blocked | Turret assemblies exist (v0.0.14, now v0.0.15) but extensions use a closed-world calling convention that cannot access gauntlet state. See turret-contract-surface.md |
| Consequence — proxy (cooldown + deny list) | ⚠️ Workaround | DF-based `cooldown_until_ms` with escalating multiplier by `denial_count` |
| Multi-gate config | ✅ Now | Per-gate `GateCheckpointKey → GateCheckpoint` DFs. Setup: 4N+1 PTB commands |
| Time pressure via permit expiry | ✅ Now | `expires_at_timestamp_ms` + `Clock.timestamp_ms()` |

### Turrets Dependency — Truthfulness Statement

Turret assemblies exist in world-contracts v0.0.14 (now v0.0.15), but the extension calling convention (fixed 4-argument signature, no external state access) prevents turret extensions from reading gauntlet state (`PlayerProgress`, `GateCheckpoint` DFs). The consequence model uses DF-based cooldowns as a credible proxy. Events (`GauntletDenialEvent`) are emitted as a future-proof integration surface that turret systems could consume if the calling convention is relaxed. The demo and vision doc frame turret integration as out of scope (structurally infeasible under the current calling convention), not a dependency.

> **v0.0.15 update (2026-03-03):** world-contracts updated to v0.0.15. Gate/turret/access modules unchanged — Fortune Gauntlet feasibility unaffected. Key inventory changes: `withdraw_item` now takes `quantity: u32` + `ctx`, `deposit_item` validates `parent_id`, new `deposit_to_owned`. See decision-log 2026-03-03.

## Tuning Guidance

### Denial Rate

| Rate | P(clean run, 3 gates) | Assessment |
|:----:|:-----:|------------|
| 5% | 85.7% | Too low — loses "Fortune" identity |
| **10%** | **72.9%** | **Recommended.** ~0.3 expected denials per run. Most runs see 0–1 denial — enough drama without frustration. |
| 15% | 61.4% | Too punitive — nearly half of runs hit denials. Risk of bad demo experience. |

**Recommended: 10% denial rate** (`success_threshold = 90`) with 15-second base cooldown escalating by denial count.

### Checkpoint Count

| Count | P(clean run @10%) | Verdict |
|:-----:|:-:|---|
| 2 | 81% | Too few — "two coin flips," not a gauntlet |
| **3** | **73%** | **Recommended for demo.** Clean arc (start → middle → end). Fits 2–3 min video. |
| 4 | 66% | Viable stretch if time permits |
| 5 | 59% | Only if demo can absorb extra denials |

**Recommended: 3 checkpoints** for demo, code supports up to 5 via configuration.

## Build Estimate

| Component | Effort | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Move package | 4–6 hours | ~200–300 LoC, standard extension pattern + `sui::random` |
| Admin config scripts (TS) | 2–3 hours | Gate authorization + checkpoint config + race config |
| Player-facing scripts (TS) | 2–3 hours | `try_issue_permit` call + `jump_with_permit` sponsored flow |
| Demo recording | 2–3 hours | 3 runs (clean, 1-denial, multi-denial), capture events |
| **Total** | **10–15 hours** | ~1.5 sprint days |

## Portfolio Impact

Fortune Gauntlet **replaces** Fortune Gate (Track C1) in the portfolio. It subsumes the same Weirdest Idea prize target with a stronger concept at moderate additional build cost (+4–6 hours over standalone Fortune Gate). The portfolio priority order remains unchanged: C3 → **C1 (now Fortune Gauntlet)** → E → C2 → F → D.

If at Day 8 sprint time is critically short: fall back to standalone Fortune Gate (original ~8 hours). The Fortune Gauntlet code is a strict superset — any partial progress on Fortune Gauntlet yields at minimum a functional Fortune Gate.
